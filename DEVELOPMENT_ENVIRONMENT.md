# AgriGrade Development Environment

Our main development environment was Visual Studio Code, chosen for its excellent React.js support, integrated debugging tools, and extensive extension ecosystem. The frontend was built using React.js with Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI design. For state management and routing, we utilized React Router and Firebase SDK.

The backend infrastructure is powered by Firebase, providing a comprehensive suite of services including Authentication, Firestore Database, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Functions. This serverless architecture allowed us to focus on application logic rather than server management.

For the AI features, we integrated Hugging Face's Flan-T5 model through their API, enabling natural language processing capabilities for the AI Chat feature. Firebase ML Kit was used for image processing tasks in the quality grading system.

Version control was managed through GitHub, ensuring collaborative development and code safety. Firebase Hosting provided seamless deployment and hosting capabilities, while Firebase CLI enabled efficient local development and testing.

The development workflow was streamlined through Chrome DevTools for debugging and the Firebase Console for backend management. This modern tech stack allowed us to build a scalable, real-time application with minimal infrastructure overhead.
